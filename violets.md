## Violet
20 year-old human who hunts dragons with a bow ever since one attacked her college for games. 
She grew up in a big city as the oldest daughter of a gamemaker in a red house. 
When she was younger, she adopted a dog, Puppy, who was oddly 101 years old. 
Though he did not live long, he ate tall plants and raccoons, making him valuable around the house. 
Her little brother is named Ikaninin and still lives at home in the city where he attends high school. When she was twelve, she went to the market and found a wonderful cat that was completely red and skilled at jumping high, walking lightly, and sneaking under blankets, rugs, and cloaks. 
She named the cat Buttercup and it has been a friend for 8 years, even traveling to college with her. Since arriving in her arboreal college, she has learned to love the forest. 
When she was younger, Violet proved her bravery as a bear had come into the city and began to attack her family's front door. 
She climbed to the roof and chased it away with her toy bow.

## Violetanino
A mousefolk friend of Violet from college, Violetanino grew up far in the woods away from other mice. 
His parents were wealthy game distrubutors who lived in a very nice steel sewing box. 
He learned a lot from the baby lava dragon he adopted, specifically that dragons grow older very slowly and that some of them are evil. 
Before leaving for college, he used his family's considerable wealth to purchase a magic sword.
Its impressive adamantine blade gleams pink in magical light and is enchanted to be a dragonslayer. 
When he met Violet at college, they became friends over their shared interest in dragons.

## Mermaid Violet
As a young mermaid in secondary school, Violet lived with her family in a log cabin under the sea near the shore. 
She loved visiting the people on the beach and in the nearby community, but did not like the loud noises they could sometimes make. 
So she may continue breathing when on land, they would pour seawater into her mouth.
For short trips, it was very manageable. 
Violet's parents were skilled at washing dishes and would offer the service at homes in and out of the water.
